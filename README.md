## ☕ Brewed to Perfection

Welcome to **Mocha Latte Cafe 002** — where every note is a freshly pulled shot of darkness. This theme is the deeper, richer sibling of Mocha Latte Cafe 001, crafted for those who crave a more intense coffee shop experience.

> *"A shot of darkness in a world of light"*

## 🌓 Two Roasts, One Experience

### **☕ Cappuccino (Light Mode)**
Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam — a balanced, warm experience that's slightly darker than its predecessor. Perfect for daytime writing sessions when you want depth without overwhelming contrast.

**Color Profile:**
- Base: `#9a7558` (Warm brown)
- Background: `#f5f0e8` (Creamy canvas)
- Text: `#382a20` (Dark roast)

### **☕ Espresso (Dark Mode)**
Straight from the portafilter — pure, unadulterated darkness. Deeper than Mocha 001, with rich coffee browns and creamy highlights that keep your eyes comfortable during late-night writing marathons.

**Color Profile:**
- Base: `#c98c68` (Rich coffee brown)
- Background: `#2e1f16` (Dark coffee)
- Sidebar: `#1a120d` (Almost black espresso)
- Text: `#e0d0c0` (Creamy off-white)
