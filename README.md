## ☕ Brewed to Perfection

Welcome to **Mocha Latte Cafe 002** — where every note is a freshly pulled shot of darkness. This theme is the deeper, richer sibling of Mocha Latte Cafe 001, crafted for those who crave a more intense coffee shop experience.

> *"A shot of darkness in a world of light"*

## 🌓 Two Roasts, One Experience

### **☕ Cappuccino (Light Mode)**

- Background: `#f5f0e8` (Creamy canvas)
- Text: `#382a20` (Dark roast)

### **☕ Espresso (Dark Mode)**
Straight from the portafilter — pure, unadulterated darkness. Deeper than Mocha 001, with rich coffee browns and creamy highlights that keep your eyes comfortable during late-night writing marathons.

**Color Profile:**
- Base: `#c98c68` (Rich coffee brown)
- Background: `#2e1f16` (Dark coffee)
- Sidebar: `#1a120d` (Almost black espresso)
- Text: `#e0d0c0` (Creamy off-white)

# ☕ **Triple-Layer Accent System - The Secret Ingredient**

Mocha Latte Cafe 002 features a unique **triple-layer accent system** that gives you unprecedented control over your theme's color palette - like having three different coffee roasts to blend together!

## How It Works:

1. **☕ Accent Presets** (Forest Brown, Midnight Blue, Burgundy, Walnut)  
   *The base roast* - Sets the overall color mood of your theme

2. **☕ Primary Accent Color** (in Style Settings)  
   *The espresso shot* - Controls borders, links, and interactive elements

3. **☕ Native Obsidian Accent** (in Appearance settings)  
   *The cream* - Affects hover states and subtle interactive elements (ex: the tags when using Custom Theme Studio use this setting)

## Why It's Awesome:

> *"It's like having a barista craft your perfect coffee - you get to layer flavors that work together to create something uniquely yours."*

This system lets you:
- Create **rich, multi-dimensional color schemes** where accents complement rather than conflict
- Use the **Midnight Blue preset** as your base, then add **orange accents** for striking contrast
- Maintain **consistent hover states** while customizing your primary accent
- Achieve **professional-level design** without needing CSS knowledge

## Try These Combinations:

| Base (Preset) | Primary Accent | Result |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Midnight Blue** | **Orange** | Deep blue hints with vibrant orange accents - perfect for focus |
| **Burgundy** | **Gold** | Rich, warm tones that feel luxurious and classic |
| **Forest Brown** | **Teal** | Earthy yet modern - great for writers and researchers |

> *"The magic happens when all three layers work together - the preset sets the stage, the primary accent provides structure, and the native accent adds subtle highlights that make everything pop."*

## Pro Tip:
For the most cohesive look, choose accent colors that are **complementary or analogous** on the color wheel. The theme automatically adjusts text contrast to ensure readability no matter which combination you choose.

This feature is what makes Mocha Latte Cafe 002 more than just another theme - it's a **customizable color experience** that grows with your needs. ☕✨
